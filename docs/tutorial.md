# Create your own activity

Sugarizer is a platform supporting a diverse set of technologies in which an activity can be created.

People who are familiar with the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework can make use of our pre-made Vue.js Sugar Components to streamline the use of Sugar functionalities. Learn more about this in the **Vue.js** tutorial below.

If you are a bigger fan of pure JavaScript, or if you are not sure about which one to pick, it is recommended to go with the **Vanilla JavaScript** tutorial below as it is much more detailed and explains all functionality workflows which even inspired the Vue.js components.

> Note that the end result of both the tutorials is exactly same, the **Pawn** activity.

Also feel free to create the new activity in a different technology, after taking structure and functionality guides from both the tutorial.
